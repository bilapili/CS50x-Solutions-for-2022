# My-CS50x
From 2022.8.23 to 2022.11.3, I've finished most assignments of the course(except week9 and Final Project, because I think I've learned enough from the course and there's no need to do the rest homeworks).

It's the first CS course I've taken in my life at 18 years old, grade one as an undergradute.

Star if it helps you.(It's my honor)

CS50 is my first step to computer science. And my next station is CS61A.
